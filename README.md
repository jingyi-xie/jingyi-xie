### About
[Portfolio](https://jingyi-xie.github.io/)

Hi Iâ€™m Jingyi Xie :wave:, a rising second-year ECE master student at Duke University.

:point_right: As a software engineer, I interned at Siemens (Corporate Technology) and EzTrain LLC (a defense&space startup). 

I'm experienced in `Java, Javascript, Python, C/C++`. I have deep computer science understanding in `data structure & algorithm`, as well as experience in `web development (Django, Javascript, HTML/CSS, React.js, Node.js)`, `C++ & Java OO design`, and `system programming (concurrency, synchronization, TCP socket)`.

I have good time management and communication skills and I am :satisfied: to work in a deeply collaborative environment.
